# Build the extension into a .vsix and install it through VS Code's own CLI.
#
# `code --install-extension` is the supported path: VS Code writes its own
# installed-extensions list and copies the files in. An earlier version of this script
# symlinked the repo into ~/.vscode/extensions and edited extensions.json by hand;
# that file is the profile's installed-extensions list, not a cache, and editing it
# made every other extension look uninstalled.
#
# The .vsix is built here and never committed, so what you install is always your
# current working tree.
